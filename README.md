A simple website made using python django for my software engineering course in my fourth semester

What the idea is:
   The ODFR portal , also known as the Ordinary Dairy Farmer Registration portal, is a web based application that allows farmers, consumers and dairy companies to interact with each other in various ways and conduct functionalities essential for promoting market linkage such as registration, purchasing, communication, certification  and business transactions.
